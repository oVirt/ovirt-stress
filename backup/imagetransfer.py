def find_host(connection, sd_name):
    """
    Check if we can preform a transfer using the local host and return a host
    instance. Return None if we cannot use this host.

    Using the local host for an image transfer allows optimizing the connection
    using unix socket. This speeds up the transfer significantly and minimizes
    the network bandwidth.

    However using the local host is possible only if:
    - The local host is a oVirt host
    - The host is Up
    - The host is in the same DC of the storage domain

    Consider this setup:

        laptop1

        dc1
            host1 (down)
            host2 (up)
            sd1
                disk1

        dc2
            host3 (up)
            sd2
                disk2

    - If we run on laptop1 we cannot use the local host for any transfer.
    - If we run on host1, we cannot use the local host for any transfer.
    - If we run on host2, we can use use host2 for transferring disk1.
    - If we run on host3, we can use host3 for transferring disk2.

    will change to FINISHED_FAILURE and the disk will be removed.
    In both cases the transfer entity:
     a. prior to 4.4.7: removed shortly after the command finishes
     b. 4.4.7 and later: stays in the database and is cleaned by the dedicated
        thread after a few minutes.

    If oVirt fails to finalize the transfer, transfer's phase will change to
    PAUSED_SYSTEM. In this case the disk's status will change to ILLEGAL and it
    will not be removed.

    When working with oVirt 4.4.7 and later, it is enough to poll the image
    transfer. However with older versions the transfer entity is removed from
    the database after the the command finishes and before we can retrieve the
    final transfer status. Thus the API returns a 404 error code. In that case
